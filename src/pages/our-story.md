  The idea for **‘Beyond the Back Door’** has been a number of years in the
  making, but really developed during the early days of the Covid lockdowns,
  when, along with so many people, we started spending more and more time in our
  garden.


  As our children had grown, the back garden had been focussed on their entertainment – for wendy houses, swings, trampolines, football, birthday parties etc etc, but by the late 2010s, as our children started to disappear off to university, we were able to start planning a more grown-up use of the space.


  We’d started this work in 2019, but having some time off work during lockdown allowed us to spend more time in the garden and really make it what we wanted it to be.


  It’s not finished, and it never will be, but the result is a space that we love to spend time in. and we’d love to help you make the best use of your outside space too.


  Whatever your situation – large space or small, whether you want a full scale revamp, or just some minor enhancements, whether you spend a lot of time in the garden, or just like to admire it from the kitchen window, give us a call, and we’ll work with you to develop some ideas. If you really like what we come up with, we’ll work with you to help you bring them to life.
